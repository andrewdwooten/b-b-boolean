# b-b-boolean
A single-page JS application to study boolean logic.
## To Get Started:
Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/andrewdwooten/b-b-boolean.git`

From the project directory in your terminal: `open show.html`
### Running a Study Session:
  1. Select Difficulty and click 'Begin Session!' button
  2. Problems will be displayed to which you may answer True or False
  3. Feedback will be displayed in the table at the bottom of the screen in order of most recent question to oldest question.
#### Useful Nuggets:
  * Roulette difficulty will randomly display questions from all other difficulties.
  * If, mid-session, you wish to change the difficulty, select another difficulty and the questions will be changed to that difficulty from the next question on.
  * Feedback is not saved; if you refresh the page you will not be able to reference it(read it's gone forever)
  * Problems are randomly generated, and it's improbable that the same problem will be generated twice.
  * A new table of feedback will be added with each study session; they are ordered from most recent to oldest.
